Adapting <I>METAL-MLEE</I>
</H1>
If you want to use <I>METAL-MLEE</I> with other learning algorithms
than those for which interface scripts (see&nbsp;<A HREF="node6.html#interface">5.2</A>) already 
exist, you need to create interface scripts for that purpose.

<P>
In a similar way, you can also add additional preprocessing algorithms. 

<P>
Adapting <I>METAL-MLEE</I> to additional algorithms essentially
consists in adding the necessary interface programs. The
best way to do this is to copy and adapt an existing interface
program for a similar algorithm. The interface programs
are written in Perl, some knowledge of Perl
will be necessary to create a new interface program.

<P>
For each type of algorithm, there is a heavily
commented template file that can be used as a basis for
a new interface program.

<P>
In order to run a certain list of interface scipts automatically
(insteading of specifying them using the <TT>-l</TT> option
of the <TT>run_exp</TT> script), edit the <TT>config.pm</TT>
script and change the lists of script names given there for
the default classification, default regression, default 
classification data-measurement and default regression
data-measurement algorithms.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00071000000000000000">
Adding Learning Algorithm Interface Scripts</A>
</H2>

<P>
In order to be usable with <I>METAL-MLEE</I>, the folliwng conditions
must be fulfilled:

<UL>
<LI>The learning algorithm should be able to read a training
  file that is in a format similar to the format of the <TT>data</TT> file 
described in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#dbformat">4</A>.  Similarily, the meta-data 
required be the algorithm should be in a from that can be derived from
the names file. Unless the learning algorithm can use the data and names
files directly, it will  be necessary to include a conversion filter
in the interface program.
</LI>
<LI>The learning algorithm should generate a persistent model file
that can be used to later assign values for the target variable for
new data records.
</LI>
<LI>It should be possible to separately call the training and 
prediction (testing) phases of the algorithm.
</LI>
<LI>The prediction/testing function of the algorithm should
take the model file generated in the training phase and a <TT>data</TT>
file and generate a file that contains only the predictions for each
of the cases in the <TT>data</TT> file, one prediction in each line.
</LI>
<LI>NOTE: the prediction function of the algorithm should output
the prediction error which needs to be captured in the interface 
script and returned to the main driver program <code>run_exp</code>. 
This program will regard a learning algorithm for which no prediction
error is returned as failed and abort the testing for that learning 
algorithm. If the prediction function does not output the error,
a dummy value must be used unless the something went wrong (see below).
The correct prediction error will be calculated by the <code>run_stats</code>
program and be available in the <code>.stats</code> file anyway.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For classification learning algorithms refer to the template
<TT>run_cla_TEMPLATE</TT>, for regression learning 
algorithms refer to <TT>run_rla_TEMPLATE</TT>.

<P>

<P></P>

</DIV><P></P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node7.html#fig:template1">1</A> shows the <TT>run_cla_TEMPLATE</TT>
file with all comments removed and line numbers added. To adapt
the file to some learning algorithm, copy it to a file 
<TT>run_cla_xxx</TT> (for a classification algorithm) where
<TT>xxx</TT> is the name of the learning algorithm.
Follow the advice given in the comments in the template file to
program the interface file for your learning algorithm.

<P>
Here a few notes on adapting the template:

<UL>
<LI>Lines 1 to 8 should be kept untouched
</LI>
<LI>The LANAME in  line 9 should be the same as the algorithm 
name portion of the interface file (i.e. the same as the 
<TT>xxx</TT> part in <TT>run_cla_xxx</TT>). VERSION should 
reflect the version of the interface file (if you want to 
diferenciate between different versions of the learning algorithm,
include that version info in the LANAME, e.g. <TT>myla2.1</TT>)
</LI>
<LI>Line 10 should contain the command needed to call the 
training phase of the learning algorithm. The variable <TT>$filestem</TT>
will contain the filestem of the three files that are prepared before
each invocation of the interface file (the data, test, and names file).
The variables <TT>$args</TT> and <TT>$trainargs</TT> are the values
passed via the options <TT>-a</TT> and <TT>-at</TT> respectively.
</LI>
<LI>Lines 12 to 15 show a loop that will process each of the lines
that is output to stdandard output or standard error by the learning
algorithm. Within the loop you can search the output for
(numeric)  information
that you want to pass back to <TT>run_exp</TT> which will 
automatically record them in the <TT>.results</TT> file and 
calculate averages. NOTE: you must process all output lines
in such a while loop, using the <code>defined($_=getLine())</code>
condition, or the interface will not work properly! If you do not
need any information from the output, simply remove lines 13 to 15.
</LI>
<LI>Line 17 shows how to pass back the information to the 
<TT>run_exp</TT> program: simply assign the value to 
a hash variable where the hash key is the desired name of the variable.
</LI>
<LI>Lines 18 should be kept unchanged: it 
shows how to finish the <TT>startCMD</TT> block
that was opened in line 10 and record the time used up by the
training phase of the learning algorithm. 
</LI>
<LI>Line 19 starts the evaluation/prediction phase of the learning
algorithm by calling a different program or the same program with
the apropriate options for prediction. The variable <TT>$testargs</TT>
will contain the value for the option <TT>-ae</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>Lines 20-24 show how to process the standard output of the
algorithm. As for the training phase all lines must be processed
that way. In addition, <TT>run_exp</TT> will only work correctly
if you pass back the prediction error in the variable <TT>Error</TT>
as shown. If your algorithm does not output the prediction error 
to standard output, you can work around the problem by passing
back an arbitrary value and ignoring the errors in the <TT>.result</TT>
file later, using the errors from the <TT>.stats</TT> file instead
(this is recommended anyway, since the errors in the <TT>.stats</TT>
file are more accurate)
</LI>
<LI>Line 25 finishes the <TT>startCMD</TT> block for the prediction
phase and should be kept unchanged.
</LI>
<LI>Line 26: the <TT>rmFile</TT> function should be used to 
remove any temporary and working files the algorithm might have created.
</LI>
<LI>Line 27 must be kept unchanged.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00072000000000000000">
Adding Preprocessing Algorithms</A>
</H2>

<P>
Preprocessing algorithms will change the database before the learning 
algorithm is applied. For each <code>run_exp</code>  experimentation run,
you can optionally specify one preprocessing algorithm. That algorithm 
will be called for each fold of the crossvalidation.
In order for <code>run_exp</code> to be able to call the preprocessing
algorithm, an interface script must be provided.

<P>
Preprocessing algorithms, like learning algorithms, have to 
process the training and testing sets for each fold separately. 
A typical interface script will contain two calls to the preprocessing
program, one for the training file  and one for the test file.

<P>
Note: The preprocessing algorithm should never use information from
the class labels in the test set! The preprocessing algorithm should
always carry out exactly the same preprocessing transformation on the
test set as on the training set. If the preprocessing algorithm
adapts itself to the input dataset you must take care that this
does not happen when the test set is processed!
For example, a class-aware 
discretization algorithm should discretize the numeric attributes
in the test set in exactly the same way as it discretizes the 
attributes in the trainingset instead of calculating new 
discretization intervals, based on the specific information in the test
set.

<P>
This is important, because of the practical reason that otherwise
the content or format of the generated training and test files could
be incompatible, but more importantly, because of the theoretical 
reason that anything else would be cheating - using information
from the test set that should be regarded as completely 
unavailble for the estimation procedure.

<P>
As with the interface scripts for learning algorithms, use
one of the scripts included in the package as a template.
