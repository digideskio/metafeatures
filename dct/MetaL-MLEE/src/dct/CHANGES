This file describes changes in DCT done by Wojciech Kwedlo.

Initial version 2.7

8.10.99 
Corrected some major bugs in memory management, 
which caused DCT to fail and dump a very large core when 
running datasets with large number of attributes 
(e.g. clean1, clean2). For that reason added matrix_free
to correctly free the memory allocated for matrices.

12.10.99 
New output, which should be easier to parse now.

13.10.99 
Corrected a bug in compare_double, which caused 
qsort to work improperly, if the differences between sorted 
numbers were lower than 1. As a result e.g. Quartiles for 
the iris dataset were not computed correctly.

Option -c name is now handled properly. The short output is written
to $name.sres, not to $filestem.sres

15.10.99 Version 2.8 released

---------------------------------------

22.10.99 

For datasets without nominal features class entropy
is now correctly stored in .sres and .res files. Previously
it was sent to standard output but not to .res and .sres 
files. 

25.10.99
Fixed missing ':' in two measures in standard output.  

08.12.99
Fixed missing measures in stabdard output.
